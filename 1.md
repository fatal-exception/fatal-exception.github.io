What does the Holy Spirit do?

Romans 8: 5-11
John 3: 1-8

Anothen : Above AND again  
Jn 3:1-8 (Turn to it in Bibles) - a complex dialogue going on, which Nicodemus never quite catches up with.  
Nicodemus: we know that you, Jesus, are a teacher from God because of your signs  
Jesus says: you can’t see the Kingdom of God unless you are born anothen  
Nicodemus: How can a man be born anothen? How can he enter into the womb again?  
Jesus: You can’t enter into the Kingdom of God unless you’re born of water and of the spirit… you must be born anothen  
We could forgive Nicodemus for being confused. What’s going on here?  
I think the key is v5 ‘water and spirit’. Baptism isn’t just being dunked in the Jordan by John the Baptist. Two things going on - physical and spiritual. 2 kingdoms, KoG.  
We see this at Jesus’ own baptism: John says (1:32) “I saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him”  
John 3 - Whole conversation is Jesus talking 2 kingdoms: the kingdom of earth and the Kingdom of God, while Nicodemus is talking about the one kingdom. Maybe Nicodemus hears ‘you must be born again’, while Jesus is saying ‘you must be born above, in new life in the Kingdom of God’.  
Jesus’ hand in the painting.  
The 2nd kingdom, KoG, is populated not by people of the flesh (v6), but of the Spirit  
We haven’t yet talked about what the HS does, I’m getting there...  
Previously on this program...  
Genesis 1:1-6 Spirit moves on the surface of the water  
Exodus 31:1-11 HS gives Bezalel wisdom, understanding and artistic designs for metal, stone, wood - creative skills for the tent of meeting  
John 14:15-21 “I will pray the Father… and He will give you another Advocate / attorney (Paraklete)”  
Luke 12:1-11 Don’t blaspheme against the HS, HS will give you the words to say when you need to defend yourself  
Creative and forensic skills (speaking truth)  
(Context) Romans 8 expands this picture of what HS does - Draws on the 2 kingdoms from John - flesh and spirit. Follow Bible in Romans.  
Context: Law of OT is Holy, but has failed to put people in righteous relationship with God because of sin. Rom 8:3 “For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh.”  
God sent His son to die for us, to deal with sin and its consequences so that we may walk ‘according to the Spirit’ v4 ✞  
What does it mean to walk ‘according to the Spirit’? And when we walk according to the Spirit, what does the Holy Spirit do?  
What Holy Spirit Does (Romans 8)  
HS loves the will of God  
vv5-6 “For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace”. Gives us a mindset that loves life and peace. If we have the Holy Spirit, then we have this mindset. Not ‘you are what you eat’, but ‘you are what you think’.  
Paul says that the mindset of the flesh frustrates God’s plans. V7 “For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law—indeed it cannot”. It is the mindset of a Godless universe, a mindset of humans in rebellion against God, and it drives decisions that don’t see the Kingdom of God. That’s why it cannot keep God’s law and cannot please God. That’s why it’s a mindset of death - it can’t conceptualise a life other than this human, bodily one - it can’t see the Kingdom of God.  
But if we have the Holy Spirit, our mindset will be altered. Not all the time, certainly not effortlessly. But if you have the Holy Spirit, there is a part of you that loves the will of God and wants the KoG to grow in the world. It will be in touch with ways in which KoG is already growing, and will love to join in.  
This affects the way that we make decisions, the issues that we choose to get involved with, the way that we treat people  
Prayerful, listen for the promptings of HS  
HS empowers new, resurrection life in us  
V11 - “If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies”  
When Jesus died on the Cross, he lay in a tomb for 3 days. Then God raised Him from the dead, and he walked around on earth again before ascending into Heaven - this is what we celebrate at Easter, His Resurrection.  
A mini-resurrection event happens in us. That same source of power bubbles away in our own person too, making new life possible in all areas of our lives where we persistently act in ways that we just don’t want to.  
Paul’s argument throughout Romans is that this resurrection power frees us from the power of sin - this doesn’t mean that we just stop doing things we don’t want to, but it means that God can and does change us when His spirit is at work  
So as well as giving us HS which desires to do God’s will, we are also given new life to carry it out  
Word of caution - v10 says that “the body is dead because of sin”, but Paul is saying only that our bodies are mortal, not that they are worthless. A few weeks ago at Harvest, we gave thanks to God for the glory of His creation, including our human bodies. It would be a mistake to draw a big red line between the body and the soul. Actually, the body is still a “temple” for the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:19), a beautiful thing made by God.  
Paul is saying in v11 that this very mortal body can be enlivened/animated by the HS taking up residence in us  
Irenaeus, Against Heresies - the glory of God is a human being fully alive. Life in all its fullness (Jn 10)  
If you have the Holy Spirit, you are filled with God’s life, for God’s glory  
HS brings communion with God  
V9  “the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.”  
‘Communion’ is quite a churchy word - If we have the Spirit of God, then we belong to God.  
Eph 1:13-14 “you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God’s own people”  
(SLIDE) Other pledges: wedding ring, Met Police oath of duty, sister-in-law citizenship (oath of allegiance to the monarch) …  
If you have the HS, it is a seal, a pledge that says you belong to the people of God.  
2 big differences:  
 Unlike the ones above, we can’t publically verify that someone has received the HS. But God knows. Sermon next week about being filled with HS.  
Not a pledge we keep by our own efforts, but one that God keeps on our behalf. Romans 8:15 - “For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption”. God is the parent-figure protecting us and welcoming us into His family.  
To close, back to John 3, v8: “The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Like the wind, we can hear HS and see what it does, but can’t follow it.  
The Holy Spirit does a lot of things! HS encompasses the mystery of all the work that God is doing in the world.  
Where’s Wally? Trinity edition. Discuss with your neighbour?  
God the Father - Matt 23:9 “And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”  
God the Son - Heb 7:25 “Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.”  
God the Holy Spirit - John 3:8 “wind blows…” who knows where the Holy Spirit is? It lives in us, but it’s also constantly at work in the world bring forward the Kingdom of God. Genesis 1 it was blowing around in Creation, and it still is.  
What Nicodemus didn’t see is that we’re called to join the Holy Spirit, listening for its work and taking part in the Kingdom as best we can, catching its infectious love for the will of God, being empowered with its resurrection of our life, and receiving its pledge that we belong to God as His children  
Amen.
